## 📋 Overview

AkademiTrack is a desktop automation tool designed for students at Akademiet schools in Norway. It automatically monitors your schedule and registers attendance for **STU** (Selvstendige Terminoppgaver / Independent Term Projects) sessions when registration windows open, eliminating the need to manually track and register throughout the day.
